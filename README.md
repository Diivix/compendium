# Compendium

The source of knowledge

## What I was doing

Character Compendium!

1. Do you need to use redux when getting the characters, or can I just use the local state?
2. Add a create character function.
3. Create the CharacterCard component.
4. Add a delete character component.

## TODO

- Add omnibar sear to the navigation menu to search for spells and characters.

- Allow spells to be selected/searched by name.
- Allow an AND/OR toggle in the filters mutli-select bar.
- Implement 'sort by' for spells.
- Fix format of spells (css flex-box) when there are an odd number of spells shown.
- Add a back button on the full spell back to return to the Spells Compendium.

## Ideas

### Colour pallette

- Black or very dark grey background.
- Gold outlining of components
- Silver for click able components on hover.
- Dark grey for background images.
